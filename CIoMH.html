            <h2>Come Inside of My Heart - IV of Spades</h2>
            <p>
                I love you<br>
                But I don't really show you<br>
                I'd call you<br>
                But only if you want me too<br>
                <br>
                Oh, don't you let it stop<br>
                Oh, I won't let it happen, baby<br>
                I will never stop<br>
                But only if you listen to me<br>
                <br>
                Come inside of my heart<br>
                If you're looking for answers<br>
                Look at the stars, go a little bit faster<br>
                Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh<br>
                <br>
                Come inside of my heart<br>
                If you're looking for answers<br>
                Look at the stars, go a little bit faster<br>
                Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh<br>
                <br>
                Oh, baby<br>
                Forgive me if I hurt you<br>
                Come save me<br>
                'Cause you're the only one for me<br>
                <br>
                Oh, don't you let it stop<br>
                Oh, I won't let it happen, baby<br>
                I will never stop<br>
                But only if you listen to me<br>
                <br>
                Come inside of my heart<br>
                If you're looking for answers<br>

                Look at the stars, go a little bit faster<br>
                Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh<br>
                <br>
                Whatever happens to me, baby<br>
                I'm sorry<br>
                No one could ever go my way<br>
                I love you<br>
